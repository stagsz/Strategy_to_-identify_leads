# Strategy to identify waste-to-energy condensation projects in
## Europe and the Nordic countries

# 1. To identify waste-to-energy condensation projects in Europe and the Nordic countries, we can adopt several strategies:

## 1.1.Target Industry and Municipal Authorities
    
    Municipal Waste-to-Energy Plants: Contact public and private entities running waste-to-energy
    plants, as they often need to upgrade their energy recovery systems.
    District Heating Networks: Many cities/private operators in Europe and the Nordics operate district
    heating systems, which could benefit from heat recovery equipment like GMAB flue gas scrubbers.
    Utility Companies: Collaborate with utility companies involved in renewable energy, waste-toenergy, and sustainability projects.

## 1.2.Explore Renewable Energy and Circular Economy Policies
    
    Government Funding and Regulations: Stay informed about EU and Nordic energy policies
    promoting waste-to-energy and energy recovery. Look for projects supported by initiatives like the
    European Green Deal, Horizon Europe, and local climate action programs.
    Environmental Goals and Carbon Reduction Targets: Companies and municipalities striving to
    meet decarbonization goals may be interested in upgrading their energy efficiency systems.

## 1.3.Partnerships with Engineering and Construction Firms
    
    EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) Contractors: Build partnerships with EPC firms
    involved in energy infrastructure projects. These companies may be working on new waste-toenergy plants or retrofits of existing plants.
    Industry Associations: Join associations like ESWET (European Suppliers of Waste-to-Energy
    Technology) CEWEP (Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants) or EUROHEAT &
    POWER (International network for district energy, promoting sustainable heating and cooling in
    Europe and beyond), where we can network and learn about upcoming projects.
